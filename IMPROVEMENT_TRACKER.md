## Critical Issues (Fix First)

### ✅ Issue 1: Execution Timing Lookahead Bias - FIXED
**Problem:** Running at 10:00 AM ET with daily bars creates lookahead bias risk  
**Impact:** Inflated backtest results, will fail live  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

**Solution Options:**
1. Run after market close (4:15 PM ET) ✅ **CHOSEN**
2. Explicitly fetch previous day only
3. Switch to intraday bars (30m/1h)

**Implementation:**
- [x] Update GitHub Actions cron to 21:15 UTC (4:15 PM ET)
- [x] Ensure data fetching uses previous trading day only
- [x] Add validation to prevent same-day data usage
- [ ] Test with paper trading

**Files modified:**
- `.github/workflows/daily-trading.yml` - Changed cron to 4:15 PM ET
- `scripts/update_data.py` - Added logic to use previous day if before 4 PM

---

### ✅ Issue 2: RSI Exit Logic Too Naive - FIXED
**Problem:** Fixed 20-day exit holds losers too long, exits winners too early  
**Impact:** Poor expectancy, missed profits  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

**Current:**
```python
SELL if: Held for 20 days
```

**Improved:**
```python
SELL if:
  - RSI > 50 (mean reversion complete) OR
  - Price >= VWAP (profitable exit) OR
  - Held for 20 days (fallback)
```

**Implementation:**
- [x] Add VWAP calculation to data pipeline
- [x] Update RSI strategy exit logic
- [x] Add RSI slope filter for entries (avoid falling knives)
- [x] Add distance from VWAP filter for entries
- [ ] Backtest improvement

**Files modified:**
- `src/strategies/strategy_rsi_mean_reversion.py` - Improved entry/exit logic
- `scripts/update_data.py` - Added VWAP, RSI slope, ATR, ADX calculations

---

### ⏳ Issue 3: Backtest Results Inflated - IN PROGRESS
**Problem:** +146% annual return doesn't account for slippage, costs, biases  
**Impact:** Unrealistic expectations  
**Priority:** HIGH

**Missing:**
- Slippage (5-10 bps per trade)
- Transaction costs ($0.005/share)
- Max drawdown tracking
- Win rate metrics
- Survivorship bias check

**Implementation:**
- [x] Create slippage model (7.5 bps)
- [x] Create commission cost model ($0.005/share)
- [x] Create comprehensive metrics tracker
- [ ] Integrate into execution flow
- [ ] Track max drawdown
- [ ] Calculate win rate
- [ ] Document realistic expectations

**Files created:**
- `src/execution_costs.py` - Slippage and commission modeling
- `src/performance_metrics.py` - Comprehensive metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, etc.)

**Files to modify:**
- `src/multi_strategy_main.py` - Integrate cost model and metrics

---

## High-ROI Improvements

### ⏳ Improvement 1: Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing
**Current:** Fixed 10% per trade  
**Better:** Position Size ∝ 1 / ATR(20)

---

### ⏳ Improvement 2: Portfolio-Level Risk Controls
**Current:** Per-strategy rules only  
**Missing:** Portfolio brain

**Add:**
- Max portfolio heat (≤ 30% capital exposed)
- Max correlated exposure
- Max daily loss (-2% → no new trades)

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Create portfolio risk manager
- [ ] Add exposure tracking
- [ ] Add daily loss circuit breaker
- [ ] Integrate with execution flow

**Files to create:**
- `src/portfolio_risk_manager.py`

**Files to modify:**
- `src/multi_strategy_main.py`

---

### ⏳ Improvement 3: Strategy Correlation Filter
**Problem:** Strategies not independent (RSI, Volatility, MA all momentum-based)  
**Solution:** Reject trades if correlation > 0.7 with existing positions

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Calculate 60-day rolling correlation
- [ ] Add correlation check before trade execution
- [ ] Track correlation metrics
- [ ] Test impact on diversification

**Files to modify:**
- `src/multi_strategy_main.py`
- New: `src/correlation_filter.py`

---

### ⏳ Improvement 4: Expected Value Signal Scoring
**Current:** "Top 3 signals" by vague confidence  
**Better:** Score = (Expected Return) / (Expected Volatility)

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Calculate historical avg return per signal type
- [ ] Use ATR for volatility estimate
- [ ] Rank signals by EV score
- [ ] Replace top-3 with top-EV

**Files to modify:**
- All strategy files (add EV calculation)
- `src/multi_strategy_main.py` (update prioritization)

---

## Strategy-Specific Improvements

**Files to modify:**
- `src/strategies/strategy_rsi_mean_reversion.py`

---

### 📊 Strategy 2: MA Crossover

## Questions for Future Review

1. Should we disable underperforming strategies automatically?
2. What's the optimal rebalancing frequency?
3. Should we add options data for volatility signals?
4. How to handle earnings announcements systematically?
5. Should we move to intraday execution eventually?
